                application allows both the customer and the firm to register
                their data ahead to visiting a certain company, allowing the
                user to have a stress-free experience. The site will allow the
                user to enter data specific to their needs in order to make a
                reservation, and the organization will then respond by offering
                the client with an available time slot, date, and other
                necessary information. This would shorten the client's wait time
                and avoid needless delays, which are typical in government and
                private companies with long lines that are normally managed by a
                token system
